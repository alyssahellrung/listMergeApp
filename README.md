# List Merge App

## A simple web app to streamline the combination of two lists.

## But Why?
My wife and I often make separate grocery lists when we notice foods or products are running low. Inevitably, she will have things on her list that are not on mine, and just as inevitably, a lot of the items are on both of our lists. Whoever needs to do the shopping then has to take both lists and combine them, weeding out the duplicates. So I made an app to do that combining task for us!
